capabilities.

users are the actors, so only give them references to objects that we
will allow them to do anything they want to do with.

control object references in factories.

things_i_can_see = ThingFactory.searchForThings( search_criteria, user_object )

this puts the security into these factories - they need to make sure
that what the give to the user is only what they're allowed to use.

so what if another object wants an object?  hmm...

the validation has to always come from a user, so objects must have a
reference to the user and their permissions to be able to get at the
factories with those to unlock objects and get what the user would be
able to see.
