========================
FGDB.rb Coding Standards
========================

These are some point to keep in mind while working on this project to
keep things clean and maintainable.  Don't consider these laws or in
any way unbreakable, but consider each point and what it is attempting
to enforce, and try to adhere to a similar philosophy.


Documentation
-------------

Add API level documentation inline to classes, modules, methods and
functions you write, so that a full set of useful docs can be
generated from the source, generally using the rdoc format.


Readable Code
-------------

Keep the code well-formatted, simple, concise, descriptive and if
possible, poetic.  Choose readability over cleverness.


Test First
----------

Do not write code that is not related to making a test pass. Write
extensive tests that consider many boundaries and exceptional cases.
Change the tests to match your design as it evolves.
