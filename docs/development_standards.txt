=============================
FGDB.rb Development Standards
=============================

These are some point to keep in mind while working on this project to
keep things clean and maintainable for everyone involved.  Don't
consider these as laws or in any way unbreakable, but consider each
point and what it is attempting to enforce, and try to adhere to a
similar philosophy.


Documentation
-------------

Add API level documentation immediately preceeding all classes,
modules, methods and functions you write, so that a full set of useful
docs can be generated from the source, generally using the rdoc
format.


Readable Code
-------------

Keep the code well-formatted, simple, concise, descriptive and, if
possible, poetic.  Choose readability over cleverness.  Use
whitespace.  Avoid having to document individual pieces of code by
making it very readable.


Simplify
--------

Tend towards the fewest number of classes, methods, layers or
abstractions as can be reasonably used to accomplish the tasks to be
done.


Test First
----------

Do not write code that is not related to making a test pass. Write
tests that consider many boundaries and exceptional cases.  Change the
tests to match your design as it evolves.  Run the tests often as you
write code.

Health
------

Code cleanliness is important. So is developer health. We recommend Workrave
for keeping hands and muscles in good shape, as well as chips, salsa, and 
organic veggies for keeping all parts of the body happy. Chocolate is also
good. Frequent rest breaks (at least once per day) are considered a 
necessity. When sick, lots of fluids with electrolytes should be consumed.
