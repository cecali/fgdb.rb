### roadmap for 13 oct
TODO
----
. blow away the old scaffold
. implement that design


### 12 oct
DONE
----
. designed general user interface flow for contacts:
  . the same search field and dropdown we have now, but with better
    focus control and make search field ever-present
  . better details box on selected contact, with link/button for edit
  . create button that appears after first search
  . edit/new form should call attention with:
    . color
    . disabling relevant portions of the parent form (e.g. submit)
    . placement (either custom or reasonable default)
  . while adding relationships we may not be allowed to create new
    contacts (recursion!)
  . organization or not will change the form - make it the first
    question
  . admin-only delete button
  . after creation, details and dropdown update with new contact
  . can details be preloaded for all possible values and just hidden
    as needed?  does that help speed?
