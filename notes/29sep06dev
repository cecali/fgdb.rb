  must have unique id

    plugin to manage its screen objects
    . hierarchical coordination of ids btw surrounding elements
    and input, delete elements

. add ajax logic to manage donation fee-tracking calc/display
    . some special elements that we are using to track fees, etc
    . needs some id-related changes in datalist_for to be able to 
    identify and group the data input elements that we track

. consider contact attributes:  preferred_contact_method_id
  . maybe add a radio button set going against bridge table
