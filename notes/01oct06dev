### roadmap for  3 oct
TODO
----

. ? rails unique-id generator

. add ajax logic to manage donation fee-tracking calc/display
    . some special elements that we are using to track fees, etc
    . needs some id-related changes in datalist_for to be able to 
    identify and group the data input elements that we track

. consider contact attributes:  preferred_contact_method_id
  . maybe add a radio button set going against bridge table

. figure out how we want to provide searchability for contact
and maybe other models


### 01 oct
DONE
----

. review possible alternatives to datalist_for - if another has
solved the basic issue with ids, it may be better-designed overall

  - 'sublist' plugin has a smaller codebase than d_f but it
    requires more fiddling with the app to integrate/use it.
    Still, if the tighter code proves to be coupled with a
    cleaner desgin, it could be worth it to switch.

- Add sort order for contacts to belongs_to tables.

- Add changed (but not quite perfect) datalist_for and
  associated app code (incl donations controller and _new_edit
  partial and donated gizmos _form partial.

- Instrument datalist_for.rb for logging. (Add log
  file log/alog, too).

- Add DonatedGizmo#before_save to force
  gizmo_type to nil when needed.
