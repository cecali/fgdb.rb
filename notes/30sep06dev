### roadmap for  3 oct
TODO
----

. ? rails unique-id generator

. review possible alternatives to datalist_for - if another has
solved the basic issue with ids, it may be better-designed overall

. add ajax logic to manage donation fee-tracking calc/display
    . some special elements that we are using to track fees, etc
    . needs some id-related changes in datalist_for to be able to 
    identify and group the data input elements that we track

. consider contact attributes:  preferred_contact_method_id
  . maybe add a radio button set going against bridge table

. figure out how we want to provide searchability for contact
and maybe other models


### 30 sep
DONE
----

. checkout wobble active rbac code here as external project

. mock up some gizmo classes to capture 29sep discussion.  See
notes/gizmos/ for the sandbox

. modify datalist_for to give unique ids to each element that we
need to modify via code as well as datalist_for-specific elems
    . see revision 162
  . all these can can exist multiple times in document so each
  must have unique id
  . to include: 
    . every screen input field
    . tables, divs, spans, buttons, other elements created by
    plugin to manage its screen objects
    . hierarchical coordination of ids btw surrounding elements
    and input, delete elements
