### roadmap for 19 oct
TODO
----

. add detail (gizmo_event) lines into sale_txn
  . extend GizmoSummer to handle sale txn-related amounts

. incorporate Contact search into relationships controller, view

. design widgets for searching for one or multiple contacts
  . couple results with ability to edit, delete
  . figure out smart button placement for "add new contact"

. add ajax logic to manage donation fee-tracking calc/display
    . some special elements that we are using to track fees, etc
    . needs some id-related changes in datalist_for to be able to 
    identify and group the data input elements that we track

. consider contact attributes:  preferred_contact_method_id
  . maybe add a radio button set going against bridge table

. integrate datalist_for with situation where two layers of
belongs_to associations exist under the parent
  . eg, GizmoEvent belongs to DonationLine belongs to Donation

. ? rails unique-id generator

### 18 oct
DONE
----

. Working version of contacts search tied to create new contact
function

. Schema changes:

  . Rename table gizmo_attr_types to gizmo_attrs to better
  reflect that it is where we record the attributes assumed by
  various gizmos

  . Rename table gizmo_attrs to gizmo_typeattrs to accord with
  its function to relate gizmo_types to gizmo_attrs tables
    . this is a bridge table with a non-rails name chosen to
    allow traditional rails naming of other bridge tables (see
    below) without creating overlong bridge table names

  . Rename table gizmo_attrs_gizmo_contexts to 
  gizmo_typeattrs_gizmo_contexts to correctly name its bridged
  tables.  Rename one column for same reason.

  . Rename table gizmo_attrs_gizmo_events to 
  gizmo_typeattrs_gizmo_events to correctly name its bridged
  tables.  Rename one column for same reason.

  . Drop a bunch of columns from gizmo_types and gizmo_events on
  the theory that they ought to be handled via the gizmo_attrs
  and gizmo_typeattrs tables.  We'll see how it goes.  ;-)
