### roadmap for  6 oct
TODO
----

. ? rails unique-id generator

. add ajax logic to manage donation fee-tracking calc/display
    . some special elements that we are using to track fees, etc
    . needs some id-related changes in datalist_for to be able to 
    identify and group the data input elements that we track

. consider contact attributes:  preferred_contact_method_id
  . maybe add a radio button set going against bridge table

. integrate datalist_for with situation where two layers of
belongs_to associations exist under the parent
  . eg, GizmoEvent belongs to DonationLine belongs to Donation

### 05 oct
DONE
----

. additional schema changes to accommodate revamped gizmo design
  . donated gizmo, sale txn line gone
    . donation line, sale line in their place
    . latter models are basically a bridge from their parent
    model to the gizmo event model

. choose means to provide searchability for models such as
contact
  . chose and installed
    . searchable
      . http://searchable.rubyforge.org/
      . script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/searchable/trunk
      . sounds like it automatically updates index when an
      instance is updated or removed
      . tackling two significant backends a plus
      . good howto at rubyforge main page
      . requires either ferret or solr backend
        . http://ferret.davebalmain.com/trac
        . gem install ferret

. make a stab at creating rdoc, ri for searchable
$ cd .../plugins/searchable
$ rdoc -f html -i lib -i README -o rdoc --inline-source --line-numbers -t 'Searchable'
$ sudo rdoc --ri-site -i lib -i README  --inline-source --line-numbers -t 'Searchable'

  . also considered these:
    . ActiveSearch
      . http://julik.nl/code/active-search/
      . can be pure ruby (by default it is)
      . can use ferret
      . seems a bit less mature, with perhaps a smaller user
      community at present
    . acts_as_searchable
      . http://ar-searchable.rubyforge.org/
      . requires HyperEstraier base search engine
        . http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/
        . can install as either pure ruby or ruby C binding
        . requires ruby 1.8.4 (difficult at moment for gp)
    . acts_as_ferret
      . http://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/
      . looks solid, less documentation outside the code that I
      could find
      . possibly not being currently maintained
