VhostingRoutes
==============

Adds a condition to routing for the host of the request. If you know
about CGI, this is the SERVER_NAME variable. It's just the hostname
part of the URL that the user types in. This can be useful if you need
rewrite expressions based on the vhost but have many, changing, or
limiting deployment methods and don't want to maintain configuration
files for different web servers.
