Bugs:
- first shift generated is often wrong color
- drop downs on filter criteria, etc. lose values
- WorkShift.create_from_XXX can't set coverage_type_id
- limit shifts to a single worker who has no shifts bombs

Features:
- effective and ineffective date UI components for meetings
- effective and ineffective date UI components for workers
- make all effective and ineffective dates generate SQL that
  assumes a NULL ineffective is way in the future and a NULL
  effective date is way in the past
- when editing work shifts, log what changes happen so that a log
  can be displayed if those days are re-generated
- "sprinkle" function: copy shift to every day in the week
  (standard shifts) or date range (work shifts)
- inventory all FKs to see if they are in the UI. put there if
  needed
- one stylesheet system so links appear at bottom (or elsewhere
  but consistently)
- include unavailabilities as shifts with job 0 in generated
  work shifts
- "split" function: copy shift and set end_time of this shift to
  start_time of new shift (with a default overlap of 15 minutes)
- "automerge" shifts during generation -- if the same worker (but
  not worker 0) does the same job and it overlaps slightly just
  create one shift out of the two
- on the shift edit pages limit choice of workers to who can do
  the given job -- this implies that we won't be changing jobs or
  that the worker list is dynamically generated based on the job
  value
- "copy schedule" -- this should ask for a cutoff date, set
  current schedule family's ineffective dates to that cutoff date
  minus one, create new family of schedules with effective dates
  being the cutoff date, then copy all standard shifts and meetings
  associated with the old schedule family, associating them with
  the corresponding schedule in the new schedule family
- when generating shifts, make sure to check to see which
  schedules are to be used (using schedule's effective and
  ineffective dates). expect date ranges that use >1 schedule
  family
- part day vacation support during shift generation
- part day holiday support during shift generation
- ability to filter on >1 worker and/or >1 job, in addition to
  present UI which allows filtering on 0 or 1 of each
- ability to present shifts by worker (showing job name on shift)
  OR by job (showing worker name on shift). note that meetings
  would only show up once in the job view (with many worker
  names) but would show up many times in the worker view

Database changes:
- add the 'lock_version', 'created_at' and 'updated_at' columns
  to get optimistic locking and auto-timestamping

- shifts and similar things that print on schedules should use
  inheritance:

To simplify the shift generation we should consider using
single class inheritance, which would require merging the
standard_shifts, meetings, and unavailabilities tables into one,
with an additional type field.

A new work_shifts table would likely have all the fields of the
generic table

Let's pretend that there's a generic shift thingy that has these
attributes:
- start_time
- end_time
- resizable
- has 1 weekday

A standard_shift would inherit from the generic model and add
these attributes:
- mergeable
- splitable

and these associations:
- has 1 job
- has 1 worker
- has 1 schedule
- has 1 coverage type 

A meeting would inherit from the generic model and add these
attributes:
- date
- name

and these associations:
- has MANY workers
- has 1 schedule
- has 1 frequency type
- has 1 coverage type 

An unavailability would inherit from the generic model and add
these attributes:
- all day?
- date
- effective date*
- ineffective date*
- repeats every*
- repeats on*

and these associations:
- has 1 worker
- has 1 frequency type

* note that the attributes marked with an asterisk (*) also are
  found in the schedule, meetings and standard shifts use their
  schedule's attributes, but an unavailability is not associated
  with a schedule and therefore needs its own
