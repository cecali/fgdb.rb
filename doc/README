this webapp is meant to keep track of two main areas:
 * volunteers and the time they work
 * gizmos and their flow through our organization

the /volunteer_tasks controller tracks volunteers and their hours.
the /transaction controller takes care of gizmo flow.
the /reports controller has some useful numbers.

in the near future i hope to add:
 * classes and who has completed them
 * projects (such as building and testing a computer) and who has
   worked on them

a bunch of other controllers are scattered around to support these,
but should not be used by typical users.

i did this on a debian etch box; alteration may be needed on other
distros.

To get the fgdb.rb source, which you probably have, because you're reading this:

 $> svn co http://svn.freegeek.org/svn/fgdb.rb/trunk fgdb.rb

to install a working Ruby on Rails environment:

 $> apt-get install ruby rubygems postgresql-8.1 build-essential \
        apache2 ruby1.8-dev libpgsql-ruby
 $> gem install -y -v 1.1.2 rails
 $> gem install ferret # needs build-essential

on Ubuntu Dapper you will need to get gems from the internet.

and now you need to create the database:

 $> cd fgdb.rb
 $> su - postgres -c 'createuser -P SOMEUSER'
   ::: edit config/database.yml-example to fit and move it (drop -example) :::
   ::: make sure to edit the settings for production (see next line, too) :::
 $> export RAILS_ENV=production
 $> alias rake='/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/rake'
      # yeah, etch rubygems are broken
 $> rake db:schema:load
 $> rake db:metadata:load
 $> ./script/server &

also, feel free to read the notes and listen to an audio log from our
install at the vancouver freegeek site:
