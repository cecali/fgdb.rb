== Upgrading ==

All the symlinks from /usr/share/drupal6 to civicrm
go to code/foo/latest, which is a manually updated
symlink (after "download-version.sh" is ran and all
is good).

After updating, update the current symlinks and:
http://civicrm/drupal6/update.php
and then:
http://civicrm/drupal/?q=civicrm/upgrade&reset=1
may need to be ran after upgrades.

NOTE: After upgrading, you may have to back up the database,
reinstall civicrm, then restore the old database before proceeding
with the upgrade scripts (if the configuration file is broken)

== Initial Setup ==

The scripts provided here handle installation and monitoring of updates

There needs to be a /srv/code directory containing a subdir for drupal
and civicrm. The download scripts can be used to configure the initial
versions of the software in that directory. Then, the check-version.sh
script should be installed in cron to provide instructions for updates.

Once drupal, civicrm and fgdb_civicrm_hooks are all installed into place,
the normal installation procedures can mostly be followed, described below.

=== Basic Installation ===

Initial setup involves installing apache2, php5.

This dir (and the civicrm root, see below) go in
sites/all/modules (symlinked), Custom.php goes in civicrm/api/v2/
(symlinked), download-version.sh used to download and prepare new
versions.

Create the mysql database:
CREATE DATABASE drupal7;
CREATE DATABASE civicrm;
CREATE USER 'drupal7'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal7.* TO 'drupal7'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON civicrm.* TO 'drupal7'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Then do what these URLs say to:
/drupal/install.php
/drupal/sites/all/modules/civicrm/install/index.php

After installation, you want to fix sites/default/civicrm.settings.php:
-define( 'CIVICRM_UF_BASEURL'      , 'http://localhost:8888/drupal/' );
+define( 'CIVICRM_UF_BASEURL'      , '/drupal/' );

To use relative URLs, allowing for use over ssh tunnels and such.

Quick install link (replace PASSWORD):
http://localhost:8888//drupal/sites/all/modules/civicrm/install/index.php?mysql[username]=drupal7&mysql[server]=localhost&mysql[password]=PASSWORD&mysql[database]=civicrm&drupal[username]=drupal7&drupal[server]=localhost&drupal[password]=PASSWORD&drupal[database]=drupal7&go=1

On install this module to be enabled here:
http://civicrm/drupal6/?q=admin/build/modules

NOTE: After installing a new database, you may need to log out and back in.

=== Setting up account for syncing ===

To generate a key:
php -r 'echo md5(uniqid(rand(), true)) . "\n";

Set a site key:
set CIVICRM_SITE_KEY in /usr/share/drupal6/sites/default/civicrm.settings.php

Set a users key (yes, sadly can only be done through SQL):
In the "drupal" db, get the users email: SELECT mail FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'ass';
Set it in the "civicrm" db on their contact: UPDATE civicrm_contact SET api_key = 'BLAH' WHERE id IN (SELECT contact_id FROM civicrm_email WHERE email LIKE 'root@freegeek.org');

=== Customizations for our data ===

Add custom fields for fgdb id:
To do this, go to Administer -> Custom Data and Screens -> Custom Filds
add a "FGDB Contact Information" data group used for Contacts
add a "FGDB Contact ID" field, of integer type, make it searchable
"Used for database synchronization: leave empty, will be set automatically."
[do not select "view only", this breaks using API, and therefor our sync process]

Modify the options lists our contact method types:
Go to the "Administer" => "Customize Data and Screens" => "Dropdown
Options" submenu and go to:

Location Types:
work, home, other

Phone Types:
fax, ip, emergency, mobile, other

=== NOT USED: Customizations we might do someday (but not yet) ===

do this again for donations (actually, don't)

For contacts, add custom fields:
fgdb_default_contract, Alphanumeric Select, Options:
  Value 1, Label "normal" ( default )
  Value 2, Label "City of Portland" # Should metadata be synced someday?
make required.

fgdb_pickup_fee, of type: Money, Text

fgdb_fully_covered, of type: Boolean
"can be left empty if unknown."
