This dir (and the civicrm root, see below) go in
sites/all/modules (symlinked), Custom.php goes in civicrm/api/v2/
(symlinked), download-version.sh used to download and prepare new
versions.

All the symlinks from /usr/share/drupal6 to civicrm
go to ~/code/latest, which is a manually updated
symlink (after "download-version.sh" is ran and all
is good).

http://civicrm/drupal6/update.php may need
to be ran after upgrades.

Initial setup involves installing apache2, php5.

Create the mysql database:
CREATE DATABASE drupal7;
CREATE DATABASE civicrm;
CREATE USER 'drupal7'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON drupal7.* TO 'drupal7'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON civicrm.* TO 'drupal7'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Then do what these URLs say to:
/drupal/install.php
/drupal/sites/all/modules/civicrm/install/index.php

On install this module to be enabled here:
http://civicrm/drupal6/?q=admin/build/modules

To generate a key:
php -r 'echo md5(uniqid(rand(), true)) . "\n";

Set a site key:
set CIVICRM_SITE_KEY in /usr/share/drupal6/sites/default/civicrm.settings.php

Set a users key (yes, sadly can only be done through SQL):
In the "drupal" db, get the users email: SELECT mail FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'ass';
Set it in the "civicrm" db on their contact: UPDATE civicrm_contact SET api_key = 'BLAH' WHERE id IN (SELECT contact_id FROM civicrm_email WHERE email LIKE 'root@freegeek.org');

Add custom fields for fgdb id:
To do this, go to Administer -> Customize -> Custom Data
add a fgdb_contacts set for contacts
add a fgdb_contact_id field, of integer type, make it searchable
do this again for donations
