this webapp is meant to keep track of two main areas:
 * volunteers and the time they work
 * gizmos and their flow through our organization

the /volunteer_tasks controller tracks volunteers and their hours.
the /donations and /sale_txns controllers are about gizmo flow.

in the near future i hope to add:
 * classes and who has completed them
 * projects (such as building a computer) and who has worked on them

a bunch of other controllers are scattered around to support these,
but should not be used by typical users.
